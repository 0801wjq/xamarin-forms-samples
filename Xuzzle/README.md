Xuzzle
======

This is the classic 14-15 puzzle. On the early Mac it was called PUZZLE, and it was the only sample
application in Microsoft Pascal for Windows 1.0, where it was called MUZZLE (for "Microsoft Puzzle").
This is the Xamarin.Forms version, so it's called Xuzzle. Because the program is for developers, the squares
are identified in hexadecimal.

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**

Just tap a square to move it into an empty position. You can *tap* any square in the row or column 
of the empty position to move one, two, or three squares at once.

**An issue exists as of 5/8/14 and Build 1.0.6560: the default XAML namespace will soon undergo a change.**
